This Reposirtory is for my notes, which I have written and collected throughout watching all types of Coding and Programming Educational Videos. I have written all the theory I CURRENTLY Know in this repository.

## Notes Are About:
  * JavaScript
  * Python
  * CSS
  * SCSS
  * NodeJS
  * MongoDB
  * General Notes, Which Applies to Most of the Programming Languages
  * React
  * Low-Level and Detailed Notes about what I'm intrested in
  * System Design

## Summary
That is all I know about these programming languages and frameworks. Eventually, I will broaden my knowledge and understanding of concepts, learning more theoretical stuff, while updating these files here. Also I will Improve My Skills and Get Better At Writing Code.
