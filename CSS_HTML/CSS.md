## Three Pillars Of Writing Good HTML and CSS (Never Forget them)
So the three pillars are: **Responsive Design**, **Maintainable and Scalable Code** and **Web Performance**.

**Responsive Design** -> Simply means that we build one website that works beautifully across all screen sizes on all devices.
* **Fluid Layouts**
* **Media Queries**
* **Responsive Images**
* **Correct Units**
* **Desktop-first vs Mobile-first**

***

**Maintainable and Scalable Code** -> This is actually more important  for us the developers, than for the final user of the website, but it is still something we need to follow if we want to build good website. 
So writing maintainable and scalable code, means to write code that is clean, easy to understand, that supports future growth and above all it is **Reusable** for you, as well as for other developers. 
if we want to write maintainable and scalable code we need to care and think about our CSS architecture, which is the way we organize files, how we name our classes and how we structure our mark up in HTML.
* **Clean**
* **Easy-To-Understand**
* **Growth**
* **Reusable**
* **How To Organize Files**
* **How To Name Classes**
* **How To Structure HTML** 


* ** 

**Web Performance** -> Lastly, Making a website or app more performant, means to make it faster and to make it smaller in size, so that the user has to download less data.
There are many things that affect performance and some factors don't have much to do with our code, But some of the things we can do, is to make as little HTTP request as possible meaning that we should include as little as possible files in our HTML document, write as little code as possible of course, compress our code, and use a preprocessor like SASS. 
Biggest impact we can have on performance is to actually reduce the use of images, because images are usually what makes up by far the biggest part of the size of a website. We can do so by using only images that are really necessary for a website or app, and also by compressing these images, so that we use less bandwidth for the final user.
* **Less HTTP requests**
* **Less Code**
* **Compress Code**
* **Use a CSS Preprocessor**
* **Less Images**
* **Compress Images**

## What Happens To CSS When We Load Up a Website?
So, our starting point is when the browser actually starts to load the **Initial HTML** file, it then takes the loaded HTML Code and parses it, which basically means that it decodes the Code line by line.

**Parse** -> Basically, means that it Decodes/Reads/Analyze/Process the Code line by line.


From this process, the browser builds the so-called, **Document Object Model**, or **DOM**, which basically describes the entire web document, basically like a family tree, with parents, children, and sibling elements.
So, this Document Object Model is where the entire decoded HTML Code is stored.

**Document Object Model** ->  basically describes the entire web document, basically like a family tree, with parents, children, and sibling elements.
So, this Document Object Model is where the entire decoded HTML Code is stored.

Now, as the browser parses the HTML, it also finds, the style sheets included in the HTML `<head></head>` and it starts loading them as well, and just like the HTML, CSS is also parsed, but the parsing of CSS is a bit more complex. 

In the CSS Parsing phase, there are two main steps. 
1. **Resolve Conflicting CSS Declarations (Cascade)**
2. **Process Final CSS Values**.

First off, conflicting CSS declarations are resolved, through a process known as the **Cascade**.

The Second step in CSS Parsing, is to process final CSS values.
Like For Instance, converting a margin defined in percentage units to pixels.
 
After all of this is done, the final CSS is also stored in a tree-like structure, called the **CSS Object Model**, Similar to the DOM.

Now that we have the HTML, as well as the CSS parsed and stored, these together form so-called **Render Tree**. And with that, we finally have everything we need to render the page.

In order to actually render the page, the browser uses something called the **Visual Formatting Model**, this algorithm calculates and uses a bunch of stuff, that we already know about. Like the **Box Model**, **Floats**, and **Positioning**.

Finally, after the Visual Formatting Model has done its work, the website is finally rendered, or painted, to the screen and the process is finished.

**CSS Object Model** ->
 
**Render Tree** ->

**Visual Formatting Model**

## How CSS Is Parsed. The Cascade, Value Proccessing and Specificity
**CSS Rule** -> So a **Rule** Consists of a **Selector** and a **Declaration Block**.

```css
.my-class{ /* <- SELECTOR */
	/* DECLARATION BLOCK */
	color: blue; /* <- DECLARATION */
	text-align: center; /* <- DECLARATION */
	font-size: 20px; /* <- DECLARATION */
}
```

**Selector** -> As we already know, we use the selector to select one or more HTML elements, that we want to style.

**Declaration Block** -> In a declaration block, is where we write the actual styles, in order to style elements on our page. 

**Declaration** -> To style elements on our page, we write one or more CSS **Declarations**. Each Declaration consists of a CSS Property, and its corresponding value, which is the value that we assign to a property. 

**Declared Value** -> This value we assign to a property is called the Declared Value.

```
font-size <- CSS PROPERTY: 20px <- DECLARED VALUE
```

We can write one or more CSS Declarations in each Declaration Block.


### The Cascade (The "C" In CSS)
**Cascade** -> The cascade is the Process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between different CSS rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies to a certain elements.

**Author Declarations** -> The Declarations Written By the Developer(By Us), the Declarations that we put in our stylesheets.

**User Declarations** -> Which Is Declarations Written by the User(By Any User), the Declarations that the user puts in.

**Default Browser(User Agent) Declarations** -> Which Is Declarations Written By Default, which is the browser itself, the Declarations that the browser assigns by default. It Is called **User Agent CSS/Declarations**.

### How Does The Cascade Actually Resolve Conflicts
How does the cascade actually resolve conflicts, when more than one rule applies.

The Cascade looks at the **Importance**, at the **Selector Specificity** and to **Source Order Of Conflicting Declarations**, In order to determine which one takes precedence.

**IMPORTANCE(WEIGHT)** > **SELECTOR SPECIFICITY** > **SOURCE ORDER OF CONFLICTING DECLARATIONS**

1. **Importance**:
	* Firstly, the Cascade starts by giving the conflicting declarations different importance's, based on where they are declared. So based on their source.

	  **IMPORTANCE LIST (TOP ( 1 )-> MOST IMPORTANT)**
		1. User `!important` declarations.
		2. Author `!important` declarations.
		3. Author declarations.
		4. User declarations.
		5. Default browser declarations.
	
***

2. **Selector Specificity**:
	* In this case all the declarations have the exact same importance. What the cascade does if this is the case is to **Calculate and Compare the Selector Specifities, of the Declaration  Selectors**.
	
	  **IMPORTANCE LIST (TOP ( 1 )-> MOST IMPORTANT)**
		1. Inline Styles. 
		2. IDs.
		3. Classes, Pseudo-Classes, Attributes.
		4. Elements, Pseudo-Elements.
		
	* The Selector Specificity Meters Looks Like this **( Inline Styles, ID Selectors, Class Selectors, Element Selectors )**. So It looks like this **( 0, 0, 0, 0 )**, Every Number represents the repetition of the Selectors, So for every Selector Repetition We Increment/Increase the Corresponding Selector Repetition Value **By 1**. The Highest of them wins and becomes **Cascaded Value**.
	* Pseudo-Classes Count as **Normal Classes**, So if we see them We Increment/Increase Class Selector Value By 1.
	* Pseudo-Classes Count as **Normal Elements**, So if we see them We Increment/Increase Element Selector Value By 1.

	
	```CSS
	.button { /* ( 0, 0, 1, 0) */
		font-size: 20px;
		color: white;
		background-color: "blue";
	}

	nav#nav div.pull-right .button { /* ( 0, 1, 2, 2 ) */
		background-color: "green";
	}
	
	a { /* ( 0, 0, 0, 1 ) */
		background-color: purple;
	}

	#nav a.button:hover{ /* ( 0, 1, 2, 1 ) */
		background-color: yellow;
	}
```

In this example the Second Selector wins. Because after comparing the Corresponding Selector Repetitions Values, it lost to forth Selector in the Element Selector Repetitions by 1.
***

3. **Source Order Of Conflicting Declarations**:
	*  If Selector Specifities are the same, then **the  Last CSS Declaration Written In the Code is the one That Will Apply**.
	* The Last Declaration in the Code will override/overwrite all other declarations and will be applied.
***

**Cascaded Value** -> The Value Of the Winning Declaration is called the **Cascaded Value**, because it is the result from the Cascade.

#### Summary
* CSS Declarations marked with `!important` have the highest priority.
* But, only use `!imporant` as a last resource. It is better to use correct **Specificities** - **more  maintainable Code**!
* Inline Styles will always have priority over styles in external stylesheets.
* A Selector that contains **1** Id is more specific that one with **1000** Classes.
* **A Selector that contains **1** class is more specific than one with **1000** Elements.
* The Universal Selector `*` has no specificity value ( 0, 0, 0, 0 ).
* Rely more on **Specificity** than on the **Order** of selectors.
* But, rely on order when using 3rd-party stylesheets - always put your author stylesheets last.

### Value Processing 
#### Examples
```HTML
<div class="section">
	<p class="amazing">CSS is absolutely amazing </p>
</div>
```

```CSS
.section {
	font-size: 1.5rem;
	width: 280px;
	background-color: orangered;
}

p {
	width: 140px;
	background-color: green;
}

.amazing {
	width: 66%;
}
```

* **`width` ( paragraph )** 
* **`padding` ( paragraph )** 
* `font-size` **( root )**
* **`font-size` ( section )** 
* **`font-size` ( paragraph )**

#### How CSS Values Are Processed
( **We are and will be using example above!** )
We will talk about how exactly the declared values are processed in six different steps, starting from the declared value all the way to the final actual value. 

1. **Declared Value ( Author Declarations )** -> Cascade Determines The Declared Value, If the Declared Values Are Conflicting.
2. **Cascaded Value ( After The Cascade )** -> After We Get the Declared Value, It Will Become Our Cascaded Value. The Value Of the Winning Declaration.
3. **Specified Value ( Defaulting, if there is no Cascaded Value )** -> This one is the Default Value of a Certain CSS Property, If we already have a **Cascaded Value**, then It doesn't matter.
4. **Computed Value ( Converting Relative Values to Absolute )** -> In this step, Values with Relative Units are Converted to Pixels, So that they can be **Inherited**. ( Color Names Like: Orange and Blue are **Computed** and Replaced here in this step ).
5. **Used Value ( Final Calculations, based on Layout )** -> The CSS Engine uses the **Rendered Layout** to Figure out some of the remaining Values, for example: Percentage Values that depend on the layout.
6. **Actual Value ( Browser and Device Restrictions )** -> Usually, a Float Value like this `(184.8px)` is simply rounded. In this Case `(185px)`. That is after all these calculation steps, the so called **Actual Value**, which is now ready to be used in the layout.


Step 5 and 6 only happens in the **Rendering Phase** of the page.

**Initial Value** -> Each CSS Property Has Something Called **Initial Value**, Which is simply the Value used if there is no cascaded value, in short the Default Value. So basically if we don't declare the value and if neither the browser nor the user defines a value, then the Initial Value will be used.

#### How Units Are Converted From Relative to Absolute (PX)
#### Example
```CSS
html, body {
	font-size: 16px;
	width: 80vw;
}

header {
	font-size: 150%;
	padding: 2em;
	margin-bottom: 10rem;
	height: 90vh;
	width: 1000px;
}

.header-child {
	font-size: 3em;
	padding: 10%;
}
```

So we start, with percentages, and there is a distinction, between using percentages for **fonts** or for **length** or **distance** measurements.

Percentage is technically not an unit.

#### Percentage Units
**Percentage (fonts)**:
	In the `header`, we have declaration `font-size: 150%;`, and what that means is that the element will have a  `font-size` 150% larger that its parent element. In this case, the parent element is simply the `html` or the `body` with a `font-size` of 16, So the `header` will have 150 percent of that, which gives us 24 pixels.
	
**Percentage (lengths)**:
	 When we express a length measurement in percentages, like `height`, a `padding`, a `margin` or something else, the reference is always the **Parent Element's Width**.
	 ***
	 Like in our example where the `padding` of 10 percent results in a used value of 100 pixels, because our parent element has 1000 pixels of width, and 10 percent of 1000 is of course 100.
	 ***
	 So we should never forgot, that the **Parent's Width** is the **Reference** for the percentage based calculations.

#### Font-Based Units
We also have some font-based relative units, `em` and `rem`, it is different to use `em`'s for fonts or for length. So both `em`'s and `rem`'s are font-based, but the difference between them is that `em`'s uses the parent or the current element as a reference, while `rem`'s uses the `root` font-size as the reference.

**em** -> `em` uses the parent's or the current element's `font-size` as a reference. 
So for fonts the **Reference** is the **Parent Element**, and for length, the **Reference** is the **Current Element**.

**rem** -> `rem` uses the `root`'s `font-size` as a reference.

***

**`em` ( font )**: 
	If we want to use `em`'s for font-sizes, then the reference is simply the **Parent's Computed `font-size`**.
	***
	In our example, a 3 em `font-size` on the `.header-child` element results in 72 pixels, simply because that is 3 times the parent font size, which is 24. So 3 time 24 makes 72 ( 3 x 24 = 72).

**`em` ( lengths )**:
	The 2 em `padding` on the `header`, since it is a length measurement, it uses the font-size of the **Current Element** as a reference.
	We already know that is 24 pixels, and so em will result in a 48 pixel padding (24 x 2 = 48). 

**`rem`**: 
	`rem` actually works the same way for both font sizes and length, because it always just uses the `root` font size as a reference.
	***
	That means that the 10 rem `padding` that we have here in `header` will result in a 160 pixels because the root font size is 16, and 10 x 16 = 160.

#### View port-Based Units
The view port based units are based on a browser's view port, and they are called `vh` and `vw`, basically, `vh` is just one percent of the view port `height`, and one `vw` is just one percent of the view port `width`.

**vh** -> One `vh` is just one percent of the **View Port `height`**.

**vw** -> One `vw` is just one percent of the **View Port `width`**.

*** 

`vh`:
	So when we specify a `height` of 90 vh this will simply translate to 90 percent of the current view port height.
	***
	In this specific example, we don't know what the view port height is, but the browser who is painting the page knows about it, and so it does these calculations when it is calculating the used values in pixels.    

`vw`:
	So a `width` of 80 vw, for example, is just 80 percent of the view port's width.

#### Summary
* Each CSS property has an **Initial Value**, which is used if nothing is declared ( and if there is no inheritance ).
* Browsers specify a `root`  `font-size` for each page (usually 16 px).
* Percentages and relative values are always converted to pixels.
* Percentages are measured relative to their parent's **font-size**, is used to specify `font-size`.
* Percentages are measured relative to their parent's **width**, if used to specify lengths.
* `em` are measured relative to their **Parent Elements** `font-size`, if used to specify `font-size`.
* `em` are measured relative to the **Current Elements** `font-size`, if used to specify lengths.
* `rem` are always measured relative to the `document's root` `font-size`.
* `vh` and `vw` are simply percentage measurements of the viewport's `height` and `width`


## Inheritance
**Inheritance** -> Inheritance is a way of **Propagating Property Values** from **Parent Elements** to their **Children Elements**.

#### Example
```CSS
.parent {
	font-size: 20px;
	line-height: 150%;
}

.child {
	font-size: 25px;
}
```

###
Each and Every CSS property must have  a value, Even if neither we, the developer nor the browser do specify it. In that case, there is no cascaded value, right.
When processing certain property for a certain element, such as `line-height` the first question that the CSS engines asks is: "If there is a cascaded value?", and if so, then of course, that is the value that is used.
If there is no cascaded value, then the next question is: "If the property inherited? ( Specific to each property )", So if a property is inherited, then the value of that property becomes the computed value of its parent element.

**The Value  that  gets Inherited is not simply the Unit, but the Computed Value of the Parent Element**.

In this case, that is 150% of 20 pixels, which is 30 pixels. So the `line-height` of a child element will also be 30 pixels, not 150% of the 25 pixel font size.

If it is a property that isn't inherited, like for example, `padding`then the Specified Value will become the **Initial Value**, which is also specific to each property.

#### Summary
* Inheritance passes the Values for some specific properties from **Parents** to **Children** - **more maintainable code**.
* Properties related to text are inherited: `font-family`, `font-size`, `color`, etc.
* The Computed Value of a property is what gets inherited, **NOT** the Declared Value.
* Inheritance of a property only works if no one declares a value for that property.
* The `inherit` keyword forces inheritance on a certain property.
* The `initial` keyword resets a property to its initial value.

## The Visual Formatting Model
**CSS Visual Formatting Model** -> Algorithm that calculates boxes and determines the layout of these boxes, for each element in the render tree, in order to determine the final layout of the page.
* **Dimensions of Boxes**: The Box Model.
* **Box Type**: inline, block and inline-block.
* **Positioning Scheme**: floats and positioning.
* **Stacking Contexts**.
* Other elements in the render tree.
* View port size, dimensions of images, etc.
***
**Dimensions of Boxes** -> In order to do this, the algorithm takes into account factors like dimensions of the boxes, which are calculated, by the box model. 

**Box Type** -> The box type, which can be: 
* block 
* inline
* inline-block. 

**Positioning Scheme** -> The positioning scheme, which includes concepts like:
* **floats**
* **absolute** or **relative** positioning

**Stacking Contexts** -> Stacking Contexts are what determine in which order elements are rendered on the page. Stacking contexts are like layers that form a stack, layers on the bottom of the stack appear at first and elements higher up the stack appear on top, overlapping the elements below them.

The other elements that are present in the render tree such as **Siblings**, **Children** or **Parents**.

Finally, the external information such as the current viewport size, dimensions of images, or other factors.
***

By putting all of this factors together, browser figures out how the final website will look for the user.

### 1. The Box Model
**Box Model** -> The box model is one of the factors that define how elements are displayed on a web page and how they are sized. According to the box model, each and every element on a web page can be seen as a rectangle box, and each box can have a width, a height, paddings, margins and a border. 
All of them are optional, so there can be boxes with no margins or no paddings at all.

* **Content**: Text, images, etc.
* **Padding**: Transparent area around the content, inside of the box.
* **Border**: Goes around the padding and the content.
* **Margin**: Space between boxes.
* **Fill Area**: Area that gets filled with background color or background image.
***

**Content** -> First, the content of a box is where all the text, images or other content that we specify go, we can easily define its height and width using the corresponding CSS properties.

**Padding** -> Next, the padding is a transparent area around the content, but still inside of the box. We use padding to generate white space inside of a box and we can define the padding by specifying the `padding` property in CSS.

**Border** -> Next, we can specify a border for a box and that border goes around the padding and the content.

**Margin** -> Similar to the padding, we have the margin, but instead of being inside the box, the margin is white space that is actually outside of the box itself. So we can think of margin as a space between boxes.

**Fill Area** -> Fill Area Includes the Padding, Content and the Border, but not the margin.

#### Heights and Widths
**Total Width** = right border + right padding + specified width + left padding + left border

**Total Height** = top border + top padding + specified height + bottom padding + bottom border

If we choose not to specify the height or width of a certain element, the Visual Formatting Model will just use the content of the box to determine its size. 

#### The Box Model With `box-sizing: border-box`
If we set `box-sizing: border-box` the height and the width will be defined for the entire box including the padding and the border and not just for the content area. 

What this means, at the same time is that the paddings and borders that we specify, will of course reduce the inner width of the content area, instead of adding them to the total height or width of an element.

**Total Width** = specified width

**Total Height** = specified height

### 2. Box Types: Inline, Block-Level and Inline-Block
* Inline
* Block-Level
* Inline-Block
* **

The type of a box is always defined by a display `display: box-type` property. All HTML elements have a `display` default property.

**Block-Level Box Type Or Element** -> Being a block-level box, this block will always occupy as much space as possible, which is usually 100% of its parent's width, and create line breaks after and before it, meaning that blocks are formatted vertically one after another.
* Elements formatted visually as blocks.
* 100% of parent's width.
* Vertically, one after another.

**Inline Box Type Or Element** -> Inline Boxes, they are basically the opposite of block-level boxes, because their content is distributed in lines, meaning that an inline box only occupies the space that its content actually needs. Therefore, they also don't cause line breaks after or in line with them, but instead, they just sit inside their block-level parent element. 
Box model works different in inline boxes:
First, the `height` and `width` property do not apply, which means that we cannot use these properties here, and second, we can only specify horizontal paddings and margins on inline elements.
* Content is distributed in lines.
* Occupies only content's space.
* No line-breaks.
* No heights and widths.
* Paddings and Margins only horizontal (left and right).

**Inline-Block Box Type Or Element** ->  inline-block boxes are technically also inline boxes, but which simply work as a bloc-level box on the inside. So since they are technically inline elements they also use up only their content space and cause no line breaks, but since they work as a block-level box on the inside the box model applies to them just like in the regular block-level boxes.
* A mix of block and inline.
* Occupies only Content's space.
* No line-breaks.

### 3. Positioning Schemes: Normal Flow, Absolute Positioning and Floats
* Normal Flow
* Absolute Positioning
* Floats
* ** 

**Normal Flow** -> Normal Flow means, that the elements are simply laid out on the page in a natural order, in the Code. 
The normal flow is what happens to an element if we don't do anything to it at all, if you don't float it and if you don't use position absolute on it. if you use position relative, then the element is still in a normal flow. 
* Default positioning scheme.
* **NOT** floated.
* **NOT** Absolutely Positioned.
* Elements laid out according to their source order.

**Floats** -> The `float` property causes an element to be completely taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as fat as possible, until it touches the edge of its containing box, or another floated element, When this happens, text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element, also, when an element is floated, its container will not adjust its height to the element. Which is problematic, usual solution to this is to use **clear fixes**. 
* **Element is removed from the normal flow**.
* Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element.
* The container will not adjust its height to the element.

**Absolute Positioning** -> Just like with floats, when we set the `position` property to `absolute` or also to `fixed` the element  is taken out of the normal flow, with absolute positioning the element has no impact on surrounding content or elements at all, in fact, it can even overlap them. If we want to position an absolutely positioned element we use `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` CSS Properties to offset it to its relatively-positioned container.
Absolute Positioned element can overlap other elements occupying the same space, and CSS solves that by using something called **Stacking Context**. 

* **Element is removed from the normal flow**.
* No impact on surrounding content or elements.
* We use `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` to offset the element from its relatively positioned container.

### 4. Stacking Contexts
**Stacking Context** -> Stacking Contexts are what determine in which order elements are rendered on the page. Stacking contexts are like layers that form a stack, layers on the bottom of the stack appear at first and elements higher up the stack appear on top, overlapping the elements below them.

A new stacking context can be created by a different CSS properties, where the most widely known is `z-index`. Also we can create stacking contexts using `opacity`, `transform`, `filter` and other CSS properties.
