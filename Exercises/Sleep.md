## 🛌 Brotha's Perfect Sleep Routine (Sleep Goal: 10:30 PM)

### ⏰ 6:00 PM – Light Dinner / Final Meal

- Eat your last _real meal_ 3–4 hours before bed
    
- **High-protein + moderate carbs + healthy fat**
    
- Avoid greasy/digestive-heavy stuff (shawarma bread, we lookin at you 👀)
    

Example:

> Grilled chicken, rice or potatoes, veggies, olive oil

---

### 🏃‍♂️ 7:30 PM – Light Movement / Cool Down

- Go on a **10–15 min walk** or do **stretching**
    
- Helps blood sugar stabilize, calms nervous system
    
- Avoid intense workouts here — too stimulating
    

---

### 💡 8:00 PM – Start Cutting Bright Lights

- Dim room lights
    
- Switch phone/laptop to **Night Shift / f.lux / Dark Mode**
    
- If you wanna go god mode: blue light blocking glasses
    

---

### 🧠 8:30 PM – Mental Wind-Down

- Do something **low-stim**:
    
    - Read a chill book
        
    - Journal 2–3 thoughts or goals
        
    - Do breathing exercises (like 4-7-8)
        

Optional: put on **rain sounds / pink noise** in background to calm your system

---

### 💪 9:00 PM – Light Pushups / Bodyweight Work (if you want)

- Keep it light — just to release some tension and make you feel tired
    
- Example:
    
    - 10–20 pushups
        
    - 20 air squats (if you want)
        
    - 5 minutes total max
        

Then go shower (warm if you're cold, cool if you're hot)

---

### 🥛 9:15–9:30 PM – Drink the MILK

- This is your anabolic nectar
    
- Optional: add a **tiny spoon of honey** (helps serotonin/melatonin production)
    
- Drink it ~1 hour before sleep so digestion finishes before you lie down
    

---

### 🦷 9:45 PM – Brush Teeth, Final Prep

- Try to **associate this step with "it’s almost time"** every night
    
- Consistency makes it easier for your brain to wind down automatically
    

---

### 😴 10:00 PM – Get in Bed, Chill Mode

- DO NOT “try hard” to sleep
    
- Just lie there, relaxed
    
- Think of something peaceful or visualize something repetitive (like walking stairs or beach waves)
    
- Avoid checking time if you don’t fall asleep right away
    

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Track These for 3 Days

- What time you woke up
    
- When you drank milk
    
- How long it took to fall asleep
    
- How you felt in the morning
    

We can tweak your timing based on this.
